### 🚀 Dynamic ROS2 Simulation of a Crank-Rocker Four-Bar Linkage Mechanism

Designed in **Fusion 360**, mathematically verified using **Grashof's Criterion**, and simulated in **ROS2 Humble + RViz2** with a custom real-time kinematics solver.

# 📖 Overview

This repository contains the complete implementation of **Assignment 1** for the **Mechatronics System Design** course.

The project demonstrates the complete workflow of:

- 🎨 Designing a Four-Bar Linkage in Fusion 360
- 📐 Verifying Grashof's Condition
- ⚙️ Converting the CAD model into URDF
- 🤖 Creating a ROS2 package
- 🧮 Solving the closed-loop kinematics using Python
- 🎥 Visualizing the mechanism dynamically in RViz2

Unlike conventional robot manipulators, a four-bar linkage is a **closed-loop mechanism**, while URDF only supports **tree structures**. This repository overcomes that limitation using a custom ROS2 node that continuously computes the required joint angles using inverse kinematics.

# ⚙️ Working Principle

The simulation consists of four rigid links connected using revolute joints.

```
Ground (L1)
     ●────────────●
     │            │
     │            │
 Crank         Rocker
   (L2)         (L4)
      \        /
       \      /
       Coupler
        (L3)
```

The crank rotates continuously while the rocker oscillates.

Since URDF cannot directly represent closed-loop mechanisms, the linkage is modeled as an open kinematic chain.

A custom ROS2 node then computes the missing joint angle every frame to restore the closed-loop geometry.

---

# 📐 Link Dimensions

| Link | Description | Length |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 🟡 L1 | Ground | **80 mm** |
| 🔴 L2 | Crank | **50 mm** |
| ⚫ L3 | Coupler | **100 mm** |
| 🔵 L4 | Rocker | **80 mm** |

---

# 📊 Grashof Verification

For continuous crank rotation,

```
S + L ≤ P + Q
```

where

```
Shortest Link (S) = 50 mm

Longest Link (L) = 100 mm

Remaining Links

P = 80 mm
Q = 80 mm
```

Verification:

```
50 + 100 ≤ 80 + 80

150 ≤ 160 ✅
```

Hence,

✔ Grashof's Criterion is satisfied.

The mechanism therefore behaves as a **Crank-Rocker Four-Bar Linkage**.

---

# 🧮 Kinematics Solver

The simulation uses a custom Python node to compute the mechanism geometry in real time.

The solver:

- Computes the crank position
- Calculates triangle geometry
- Applies the **Law of Cosines**
- Selects the elbow-up configuration
- Publishes updated joint states continuously

Crank motion:

```
θ(t) = 90° + 30° sin(2πft)

where

f = 0.5 Hz
```

Motion Range:

```
60°  → 120°
```

This produces a smooth oscillatory motion of the complete mechanism.

# 🎨 Link Color Coding

| Link | Color |
|------|-------|
| 🟡 Ground | Yellow |
| 🔴 Crank | Pink |
| ⚫ Coupler | Black |
| 🔵 Rocker | Blue |

The same color convention is maintained throughout:

- Fusion 360
- URDF
- RViz2

making it easy to correlate CAD and simulation.

# 🚀 Installation

## Clone Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>

cd <repository-folder>
```

---

## Install ROS2 (if required)

```bash
chmod +x install_ros2.sh

sudo ./install_ros2.sh
```

The installation script automatically installs:
